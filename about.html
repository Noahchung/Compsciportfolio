                            <p> I had very few experience with computer science prior to this class. The only experience that I had with computer science was in middle school when my friends and I messed around and changed the text on  Minnetonka Public Schools website using inspect. However I hope to lean how to create my own website in the future. I chose to enroll in this class because I am taking a computer science class at my school in September. I also took this class because I really enjoy working with technology.
