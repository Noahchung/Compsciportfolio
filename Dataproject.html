<h3> What Is The Problem That You Are Trying To Solve? </h3>
<p> The problem that I am trying to solve deals with school lunches. Under new rules, schools are required to feed students healthy lunches. However,these lunches usually do not taste very good. Often times, students waste their lunch and dump it in the trash because they do not like how it tastes. However for many people, it is still very important to eat healthy. Our target audience will be the schools across America, the parents of students, and the students themselves. A data driven predicition can help us identify what students prefer to eat so that the best possible solution can be found. </p>
<h3> The Data</h3>
<img src="Screen Shot 2017-08-26 at 1.27.05 PM.png" alt="graph">
<p> Here is a picture of a pie graph that describes the date we took. This type of information is called a survey. We gathered this information by giving multiple groups of people a questionare on what type of school lunch they preferred (Healthy or Better Tasting). </p>
     <h3> Cleaning Data and Possible Errors</h3>
     <p> We did not to clean the data because we made the survey a multiple choice survey. This means that they had to select the one of the two answers that we provided. The only possible source of error or bad data is the possibility of a surveyer purposely putting an answer that they do not agree with. </p>
     
    <h3>How We Will Use The Data</h3>
     <p>We will use this data by giving it to schools and posting it online for people to see the results. This hopefully will let schools know what the students believe is the best solution for school lunches. Decision making can be automated by using the algorithm, "Whatever solution has the most votes in the survey, should be served in schools". The automated decision making can be beneficial because it is based purely on facts and data from students. However, there can also be drawbacks to the automated system. It does not appeal or apply to all students.</p>
